# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Dataset

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for the highest number of deaths worldwide, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives annually, which represents 31% of all deaths globally. The majority of CVD deaths, accounting for four out of every five, are caused by heart attacks and strokes, and a significant portion of these deaths occur prematurely in individuals under the age of 70. CVDs often lead to heart failure, and a dataset containing 11 features can be utilized to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Early detection and management of CVDs are critical for individuals with the disease or those at high risk due to factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or previously diagnosed illnesses, and a machine learning model can be an invaluable aid in achieving this goal.
