# Heart Failure Prediction 💔

## Project Overview 🌟
This repository contains an analysis and predictive model for heart failure using classification techniques. Our goal is to accurately predict heart disease presence based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset Description 📊
The dataset includes medical records used to predict heart disease. Key attributes include Age, Cholesterol levels, Max Heart Rate, and others. Initial exploration suggests some attributes like Age and Max Heart Rate show significant correlations with the presence of heart disease.
