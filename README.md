# Heart Failure Prediction Dataset 💓

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading global cause of mortality, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually, accounting for 31% of all global deaths. Heart attacks and strokes are the primary culprits behind this alarming statistic, with a significant number of these fatalities occurring prematurely in individuals under the age of 70. Many CVDs ultimately lead to heart failure.

This dataset, equipped with 11 essential features, presents a valuable resource for predicting the likelihood of heart disease. Timely detection and effective management of CVDs are paramount for those afflicted by the condition or individuals at high risk due to factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or prior diagnoses. Leveraging machine learning models becomes instrumental in achieving this goal. 🤖📈
