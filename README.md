# Heart Failure Prediction 💔

## Project Overview 🌟
This repository contains an analysis and predictive model for heart failure using classification techniques. Our goal is to accurately predict heart disease presence based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset Description 📊
The dataset includes medical records used to predict heart disease. Key attributes include Age, Cholesterol levels, Max Heart Rate, and others. Initial exploration suggests some attributes like Age and Max Heart Rate show significant correlations with the presence of heart disease.

## Installation and Setup 🔧
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

* git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-failure-prediction.git
* cd heart-failure-prediction
* pip install -r requirements.txt

## Key Insights and Visualizations 📈
* Data Balancing Check: Initial checks for data balancing to inform our preprocessing steps.
* Correlation Analysis: Exploring how various factors correlate with the likelihood of heart disease.

## Models Used 🤖
Multiple classification models are tested, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests

## Results and Conclusion 🏁
The models' performance is evaluated, and the best-performing model is highlighted. Results indicate significant predictive capabilities, providing insights into factors most predictive of heart disease.
